# AMConnect 

This is a basic Arduino sketch to connect to a Huqsvarna Automower generation 2 robot mower. 
In it's current state it connects to the Autoower and sends the status, location and debug data to a mqtt server.

The code should be seen as a Proof of Concept code and not a real product. 

Feel free to modify it as you see fit.
